Robotic threading and knotting mechanism.
Adjustable garland length and spacing.
Compact design with modular construction.
Operated via microcontroller-based control system.

ðŸ§  Components Used:
Microcontroller (Arduino / Raspberry Pi).
Stepper / Servo motors for controlled movement.
Flower feeding roller mechanism.
Thread spools with automated knotting unit.
Frame made of aluminum or mild steel.

ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Flower vendors and decorators.
Temples and event organizers.
Small-scale flower processing units.
Training and research in automation and mechatronics.
