# Flower-Garland-Machine-Automated-garland-making-using-robotics
This project presents an automated flower garland making machine that utilizes robotics to streamline the traditional, labor-intensive process of garland weaving. Designed to reduce human effort and increase productivity, the system automates the picking, threading, and tying of flowers in a consistent and efficient manner.
